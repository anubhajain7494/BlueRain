				<h5>3. COLLECTION OF AUTOMATIC INFORMATION, USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING
DEVICES</h5>
				
				<p>We and our third party service providers, which include ad networks, use
cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information
about your use of our Website and Services, such as your browser type, your
ISP or operating system, your domain name, your access time, the URL of the
previous website you visited, your page views, your IP address, and the type
of device that you use. We also track how frequently you visit our Website
and use our Services. We use this information (including the information
collected by our third party service providers) for Website analytics
(including to determine which portions of our Website are used most
frequently, what our users like/do not like), to assist us in determining
relevant advertising (both on and off our Website), to evaluate the success
of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this policy.
Currently, we do not honour browser requests not to be tracked.</p>
				
				<p>We may obtain your device ID, which is sent to Blue Rain's servers and used
in fraud prevention efforts.</p>
				
				<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Cookies:</span> We and our third party service providers collect information from
you by using cookies. A cookie is a small file stored on user's computer
hard drive containing information about the user. The cookie helps us
analyze web traffic or informs you about your use of a particular website.
Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual, tailoring
its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and
remembering information about your preferences. When you visit the Website,
we may send one or more cookies (i.e., a small text file containing a string
of alphanumeric characters) to your computer that identifies your browser.</p>
				
				
				<p>Some of these cookies may be connected to third-party companies or
websites. The terms of use of such cookies are governed by this Policy and
the privacy policy of the relevant third party company or website. For
example, Google measures the performance of advertisements by placing
cookies on your computer when you click on ads. If you visit the Website
when you have such cookies on your computer, we and Google will be able to
tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google. The terms of use of these
cookies are governed by this Policy and Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Disabling Cookies: </span> You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web

browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies you
may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Website because it may
not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

<p>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics
with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to
cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are
embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons,
web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website to, among other
things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content,
and compile statistics about Website usage. We and our third party service
providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us
track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track
whether our emails are forwarded.</p>

gateways in connection with Website and/or Blue Rain's products and

						<li>To improve and maintain our Website and our Services (for example,
we track information entered through the "Search" function; this helps us
determine which areas of our Website users like best and areas that we may
want to enhance; we also will use for trouble-shooting purposes, where
applicable);</li>

 <li>To periodically send promotional emails to the email address you
provide regarding new products from Blue Rain, special offers from Blue Rain

	<h4>C. Electronic Newsletters, Invitations, Polls and Surveys</h4>

<p>At our sole discretion, Blue Rain may offer any of the following free
services on the Website, which you may select to use or receive at your
option. Certain of the following services may require you to provide
additional personal information as detailed below:</p>

<br />
<h5>1. ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS</h5>

<p>We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. We will gather the
email addresses of users who sign up for Blue Rain for the newsletter
mailing list. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by opting
out of receiving newsletters during the registration process, by following
the link provided in each newsletter that points users to a subscription
management page where the user can unsubscribe from receiving newsletters or
by changing their preferences in their Profile Settings page.</p>

<br />
<h5>2. "SEND TO A FRIEND"</h5>

<p>Our Website users can voluntarily choose to electronically forward a link,
page, or document to someone else by clicking "send to a friend." To do so,
the user must provide his or her email address, as well as the email address
of the recipient. The user's email address is used only in the case of
transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the
email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>

<br />

<h5>3. POLLING</h5>

<p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their
opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important
issues, Services, and/or the Website. Opinions or other responses to polls
are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. We may use a
system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a
particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about
individual users.</p>
<br />

<h5>4. SURVEYS</h5>

<p>We may conduct user surveys from time to time to better target our content
to our Website users. We will not share individual responses from these
surveys with any third party. We will share aggregate data with third party
service providers, partners, and other third parties. We also will post
aggregate data containing survey responses on our Website; that data may be
viewed and downloaded by other users of our Website.</p>
<br />

<hr>

<div class="col-sm-12">
<h4>D. Security</h4>

<p>We employ procedural and technological security measures, which are
reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from
unauthorized access or disclosure. Blue Rain may use encryption, passwords,
and physical security measures to help protect your personal information
against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however,
are 100% complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and
thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private
communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take
steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and
computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer,
choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and
keeping your log-in and password private. Blue Rain is not responsible for
the unauthorized use of your information or for any lost, stolen,
compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized
password activity.</p>

<hr>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-12">

<h4>E. Disclosure</h4>


<p>We may share the information that we collect about you, including your
personal information, as follows:<p>

<h5>1. INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO PROTECT US AND OTHERS</h5>

<p>We may disclose your information including Personal Information if: (i)
Blue Rain reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary in order to
comply with a legal process (such as a court order, search warrant, etc.) or
other legal requirement of any governmental authority, (ii) disclosure would
potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit, (iii)
reasonably necessary to enforce this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use etc.
(iv) disclosure is intended to help investigate or prevent unauthorized
transactions or other illegal activities, or (v) necessary or appropriate to
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of any person or

we have a contractual relationship in order to provide your request with
maximum exposure. The post on the third party website will include the
details of your request, including your location, and other contact details.
Interested bidders, however, will be able to click on your request on such
third party site, and will be directed to our Website where they will have

service provider on our Website interested in bidding on your request.</p>

<h5>6. IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR BANKRUPTCY</h5>

<p>In the event that Blue Rain undergoes a change in control, including,
without limitation, a merger or sale of all or substantially all of Blue
Rain's assets to which this Website relates or other corporate
reorganization in which Blue Rain participates, and is thus merged with or
acquired by a third party entity (a "Successor"), Blue Rain hereby reserves
the right to transfer the information we have collected from the users of
the Website and/or Services to such Successor.</p>

<p>In addition, in the event of Blue Rain's bankruptcy, reorganization,
receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application
or laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, Blue
Rain may not be able to control how your information is transferred, used,
or treated and reserves the right to transfer the information we have
collected from the users of the Website and/or Services to non-affiliated
third parties in such event.</p>

<p>You can review, correct and delete your personal information by logging
into the Website and navigating to your preferences page in "Edit Profile."
You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is

because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. Nonetheless,
upon your request we will close your Account and remove your personal
information from view as soon as reasonably possible based on your Account
activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain information
from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect
any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take
any other actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our
sole and absolute discretion. You should understand, however, that once you
publicly post a Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any other information
onto the Website, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have

<h4>I. Third-Party Ad Networks</h4>

<p>We participate in third party ad networks that may display advertisements
on other websites based on your visits to our Site as well as other
websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements
by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be
interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or
traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons
(including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the
effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.

<h4>J. Your Full Name and Use of Blue Rain Information</h4>

<h5>1. YOUR FULL NAME</h5>

<p>As a Registered User of the Website you will select a Full Name during the
registration process. All of your activities on the Website will be
traceable to your Full Name. Certain other people, including other
Registered Users with whom you have transacted business via the Website, can
see a large part of your activity on the Website. If you book a service with
a Registered User, cancel a scheduled service with a Registered User,
receive an offer on your posted service from a Registered User, or have
posted a service, Blue Rain may send a notice to you or the appropriate
Registered User that includes your Full Name. Thus, if you associate your
real name with your Full Name, the people to whom you have revealed your
name may be able to personally identify your Website activities.</p>

<hr>

<h5>2. USING INFORMATION FROM BLUE RAIN</h5>

<p>The Website facilitates your sharing of personal information with others in
order to negotiate, provide, and use the Services. If you agree to contract
for a service with another Registered User, you may need to reveal your
name, email, phone number, or personal address to that individual so that
the service may be performed. Please respect the privacy of others. You
agree to use the information of other users solely for the following
purposes: (a) Blue Rain-transaction-related purposes; and (b) using Services
offered through the Website.</p>

<hr>

<h5>3. ACCOUNT PROTECTION</h5>

<p>Your password is the key to your Account. When creating your password you
should use unique numbers, letters, special characters, and combinations
thereof. In addition, DO NOT disclose your password to anyone. If you do
share your password or your personal information with others, you are solely
responsible for all actions taken via your Account. If you lose control of
your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal
information and be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
Thus, <span style="font-weight:600">IF YOUR PASSWORD HAS BEEN COMPROMISED FOR ANY REASON, YOU MUST
IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY BLUE RAIN TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.</span></p>
